# DriverPass

The client, Driver Pass, wants a system that can provide better training to customers helping them pass their driving tests at the DMV. The purpose of the system is to offer online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road-training. I believe I did well gathering and thoroughly analyzing the needs of the client to create the business requirement documents. Part of the documents that can use revision are the diagrams. You can always expand on diagrams to add to a more efficient process. It is important to consider the user's needs because you are designing software for the user. If the user is not satisfied with the finished product, you are less likely to maintain business. Having different diagrams provide different process and detailed information to help visualize the process making it better to understand. In the system design document, you can see how a UML activiy diagram can differ from a UML sequence diagram.
